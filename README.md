# Starforge Nexus

A strategic 2D puzzle game built with Python and Pygame. Manage a network of star-powered nodes to channel energy to a central core, defending against void creatures that threaten your connections. Optimize your network to survive as long as possible in this unique strategy-puzzle experience.

## Features
- **Node Connection**: Click nodes to connect them, channeling energy from the core to activate defenses.
- **Energy Management**: Spend energy to create connections, balancing expansion with sustainability.
- **Dynamic Threats**: Void creatures spawn from the edges, moving toward the core and destroying nodes.
- **Clean Code**: Modular, typed Python code, ideal for learning and extending.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install Pygame:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/starforge-nexus.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```
   python starforge_nexus.py
   ```

## How to Play
- **Mouse Click**: Select two adjacent nodes to connect them, spending energy to activate them.
- **Objective**: Maintain an active network by connecting nodes to the blue core to keep energy flowing.
- **Avoid**: Red void creatures destroy nodes on contact and aim for the core.
- **Game Over**: Lose if a void creature reaches the core or if energy runs out with no active nodes.
- **Survive**: Optimize connections to maximize survival time.
